### 1\. Introduction

Describe in one paragraph what your project is about. Make it clear what problem your software is solving and the context of the solution.

We are aiming to solve the problem of having to download multiple apps for workout, meal tracking, and personal planning.\~ Our product solves this problem by being a one stop shop for all of these services. One website where you can track your calories, plan workouts, and handle personal scheduling. Extra features like being able to calculate what your ideal daily calorie intake is makes our website the perfect place for any health focused person to centralize all their life planning.

### 2\. Initial value proposition and customer segments

Report the initial guesses for the (i) value proposition and (ii) customer segment. The value proposition should make clear what your product is, the target customer, the value you provide, and why your product is unique. See examples on the lecture slides.

1. Value Proposition  
   1. Product \- An all in one website that allows customers to plan workouts, track meals, and plan in a calendar  
   2. Target Customer \- People who are interested in organizing their lives around health and being heavily regimented.   
   3. Value Provided \- We aim to make a feature rich website all packaged into one page making it the only service you need  
   4. What makes it Unique \- Our unique feature is to have a BMI calculator thats built that can decide how many calories you should be eating in a given day  
2. Customer Segment  
   1. People who are sick of using multiple applications for different parts of their health focused lifestyle. These people are extremely disciplined when it comes to monitoring diet and exercise.

*Grading criteria (5 points):* The value proposition should make clear the value from the point of view of the customer. It should not be a slogan or a description of functionality. The value proposition and consumer segment should be coherent with the text in the previous section---in particular, the value should address the problem reported above (problem-solution fit). The customer segment should not be too broad or too specific. 

### 3\. Interviews summary

Present the results of each interview (the minimum number of interviews is 1.5 \* the number of participants in the group).  You should have at least 5 questions per interview that relate to your problem and the potential value your product provides.

Review 6

Interviewee: Jay Fillerup

Interviewer: Daniel Fillerup

When: 1/28/2025

1. I don't really I just don’t eat past 8 PM  
2. Yeah I just space them out so I do push, legs, pull, and back/cardio. I sometimes forget or don’t feel like going though.  
3. I just keep track of the schedule in my head but I used to try to plan with an app but it doesn’t really work for me  
4. I wouldn’t use it to plan cause I don’t really care, but I might try to track my calories if I wanted to cut I guess  
5. Being able to track and keep goals is good for me because I like the satisfaction of seeing me keep streaks and stuff like that in other apps
