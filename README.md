## Features

- **Daily Calorie Intake Calculator**: A formula that takes in the users, age, height, sex and other factors to determine how many calories in a day they should be eating.
- **Calendar**: A grid layout calendar that shows you what tasks you have planned for each day and helps you stay organized
- **Scheduler**: A system that allows the user to create tasks for specific dates and times along with a description of the activity
- **To-Do List**: A generic to do list where less pressing tasks are meant to be put (Similar to short term reminders instead of schedules appointments)
- **Workout Planner**: System that allows you to pick an assortment of workouts and put them all together into one collection.
- **Workout Library**: List of workouts you can do containing a description of each workout, what part of your body it is training, and its expected calorie burn.
- **Save file export and load feature**: Store the users data in cookies but allow them the option to export their data to a separate file then load that file back into the cookies in their web browser. (This way if they want to clear cookies, they can still retain their information)
