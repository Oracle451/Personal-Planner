# Iron Man Planner

This is a group project for CS-386 (Software Engineering)

The Iron Man Planner is a fitness and nutrition tracker that allows groups such as athletes, trainers, and health conscious people to efficiently manage aspects of their fitness tasks by integrating all of these key elements into a single platform.

## Features

- **Greeting Card**: Presents relevant data tailored to the user like a time specific greeting and weather status report.
- **Calorie Counter**: A place where the user can add the calorie count of everything they eat in a day to see if they stay under their recommended daily intake. Count resets every day back to 0
- **Daily Calorie Intake Calculator**: A formula that takes in the users, age, height, sex and other factors to determine how many calories in a day they should be eating.
- **Calendar**: A grid layout calendar that shows you what tasks you have planned for each day and helps you stay organized
- **Scheduler**: A system that allows the user to create tasks for specific dates and times along with a description of the activity
- **To-Do List**: A generic to do list where less pressing tasks are meant to be put (Similar to short term reminders instead of schedules appointments)
- **Workout Planner**: System that allows you to pick an assortment of workouts and put them all together into one collection.
- **Workout Library**: List of workouts you can do containing a description of each workout, what part of your body it is training, and its expected calorie burn.
- **Save file export and load feature**: Store the users data in cookies but allow them the option to export their data to a separate file then load that file back into the cookies in their web browser. (This way if they want to clear cookies, they can still retain their information)
- **Streak feature**: If the user stays consistent with meeting their exercise goal and staying within their daily calorie intake then have a streak counter startup that increases by one for each day gained.
